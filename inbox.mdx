## What is the Inbox?

The **Inbox** is where proactive reports from your agents land. Instead of asking questions manually, you set up agents to run on a schedule (e.g. every Monday at 9am). Each run produces a report that appears in your Inbox.

**Why it matters:** Evidence-backed answers and proactive alerts so you spend less time searching and more time deciding. Reports land in one place; open any run to read, follow up, or push to Notion.

## How it works

1. You create an **Agent** with a question and schedule (e.g. "What are the top open issues?" every Monday).
2. Ravell runs the agent at the scheduled time.
3. The report appears in your **Inbox** with the same format as an Ask answer: evidence-backed, with citations.
4. You open the report to read it. Use **Open in Chats** to move it to the main Asks view if you want to follow up.

## Inbox layout

- **Get started**: The product tour is always first. Use it to onboard new teammates.
- **Recent runs**: Below that, your agent runs appear in reverse chronological order.
- **Status**: Each run shows its status (completed, failed, running). Click a run to read the full report.

## Acting on reports

- **Read**: Open a run to see the full answer with citations.
- **Open in Chats**: Move the report into the main Asks view so you can ask follow-up questions.
- **Push to Notion**: If Notion is connected, push the report to a Notion page for sharing.

## Tips

- Use agents for recurring questions: weekly summaries, standup digests, "top issues" reports.
- Scope agents to specific sources (e.g. Linear only) for focused answers.
- Check the Inbox regularly to stay on top of proactive insights without manually asking each time.
