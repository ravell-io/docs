## What is Context?

**Context** is the central place where Ravell learns about you and your team. It combines your **individual profile**, your **workspace profile**, and your **Memory** — everything Ravell uses to personalize answers and surface what matters most.

---

## How to open Context

- **Sidebar** → Click **Context** in the left rail.
- **From an answer** → When viewing an answer, use **View context used** (if available) to see which profiles and memory were used for that response.

## What Context includes

| Part | What it does |
|------|---------------|
| **Individual profile** | Your role, focus areas, current work, and planned work. Helps Ravell prioritize issues and context relevant to you. |
| **Workspace profile** | Your team's mission, goals, product context, and ICP. Aligns answers with team priorities. |
| **Memory** | Facts Ravell has learned from your questions and conversations (preferences, context you've shared). |

Together, these make answers more relevant and actionable.
