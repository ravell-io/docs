## Why scope queries?

By default, Ravell searches across all connected sources (Linear, Notion, Intercom, Slack). Sometimes you want to narrow the search:

- **Faster answers**: Fewer sources mean less data to search.
- **Focused results**: When you know the answer is in one tool (e.g. Linear only).
- **Time bounds**: Limit to recent data (e.g. "last 7 days") for more relevant results.

## Scope to specific sources

When asking a question, you can limit the search to one or more sources:

- **Linear only**: "What are the top open issues?" → searches only Linear.
- **Intercom only**: "What did customers say about pricing?" → searches only Intercom.
- **Slack + Linear**: Combine sources when the answer might span both.

Use the source selector (if available) in the Ask input or in the question composer to choose which sources to include.

## Scope to time ranges

Some questions support time filters:

- "What did we ship **last week**?"
- "Summarize Intercom feedback from **last month**."
- "What are the top issues **in our current cycle**?"

Ravell interprets relative time ranges and scopes the search accordingly. For cycle-based questions, Linear cycle dates are used when Linear is connected.

## Scoping in Agents

When creating an Agent, you can set a default scope:

- **Sources**: Limit the agent to specific sources (e.g. Linear only).
- **Time**: The question text can include time bounds (e.g. "this week", "current cycle").

This keeps agent reports focused and consistent.
