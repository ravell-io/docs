## What is Memory?

**Memory** is Ravell's store of what it learns about you over time. When you ask questions, have conversations, or share context, Ravell can remember key facts (e.g. "You work on the checkout team" or "You prefer summaries in bullet points"). This helps personalize future answers across sessions.

**Why it matters:** Facts you share are extracted and stored. Next time, they're already in context. For each question, Ravell pulls the most relevant memories; your role and identity are always included. The more you use Ravell, the better it understands you and the less you need to repeat yourself.

## What Memory stores

- **Preferences**: How you like answers formatted, level of detail.
- **Context**: Facts you've shared (role, projects, team structure).
- **Patterns**: Recurring topics or sources you use often.

Memory is used to improve relevance and avoid repeating information you've already provided.

## View and edit Memory

1. Go to **Settings → Memory**.
2. You'll see what Ravell has stored about you.
3. You can **edit** or **delete** individual items.
4. Use **Add** to explicitly tell Ravell something to remember.

## Clear Memory

If you want to start fresh:

1. Go to **Settings → Memory**.
2. Click **Clear memory**.
3. Confirm. Ravell will stop using stored facts for personalization until you provide new context.

## Control what gets stored

- **Explicit additions**: When you add something in Settings → Memory, it's stored.
- **Conversation context**: Ravell may infer facts from your questions and answers. You can delete anything you don't want stored.
- **Privacy**: Memory is scoped to your account. Workspace members do not see your personal memory.
