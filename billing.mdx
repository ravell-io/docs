## Overview

Ravell uses **Polar** for billing. You can manage plans, checkout, and access the customer portal from Settings.

---

## Plans

Ravell offers different plans (e.g. Free, Pro, Team). Plan features and limits are shown when you sign up or in **Settings → Billing**.

---

## Checkout

When upgrading or changing plans:

1. Go to **Settings → Billing**.
2. Select a plan and click **Subscribe** or **Upgrade**.
3. You're redirected to Polar's checkout.
4. Complete payment. Your workspace is updated automatically.

## Customer portal

The **Customer portal** lets you:

- Update payment method.
- View invoices.
- Change plan or cancel.

Access it from **Settings → Billing → Manage subscription** (or similar). You'll be redirected to Polar's hosted portal.

## Workspace billing

Billing is per workspace. Each workspace has its own subscription. If you have multiple workspaces, each is billed separately.
