## Overview

Integrations are OAuth connections to Linear, Notion, Intercom, and Slack. They are scoped to a workspace.

---

## List integrations

`GET /api/v1/workspaces/:workspace_id/integrations`

Returns all integrations for the workspace.

**Response**: Array of integration objects with `id`, `provider`, `status`, `synced_at`, etc.

---

## Get integration

`GET /api/v1/workspaces/:workspace_id/integrations/:id`

Returns a single integration with details.

---

## Create integration

Integrations are typically created via OAuth flow, not a direct API call. The user is redirected to the provider (Linear, Notion, etc.) and returns to a callback URL. The callback creates the integration.

For programmatic setup, refer to the OAuth flow documentation for each provider.

---

## Update integration

`PATCH /api/v1/workspaces/:workspace_id/integrations/:id`

Updates integration settings (e.g. team selection for Linear, channel selection for Slack).

**Request body** (varies by provider):

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "linear_team_ids": ["team-uuid-1", "team-uuid-2"],
    "slack_channel_ids": ["channel-id-1"]
  }
}
```

---

## Delete integration

`DELETE /api/v1/workspaces/:workspace_id/integrations/:id`

Disconnects the integration and stops syncing. Indexed data may be removed.
