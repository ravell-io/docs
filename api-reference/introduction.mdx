description: "Authentication, base URL, and workspace headers"
---

## Base URL

```
https://api.ravell.io/api/v1
```

For local development, use `http://localhost:3000/api/v1`.

---

## Authentication

All API requests require a **JWT** in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
```

Obtain a JWT by signing in via the web app or the authentication endpoints. Tokens expire; refresh as needed.

---

## Workspace headers

Ravell is multi-tenant. Most endpoints are scoped to a workspace. Include the workspace ID in the request:

```
X-Workspace-Id: <workspace_uuid>
```

Some endpoints (e.g. user, workspaces) do not require this header. Endpoints under `/workspaces/:id/...` use the URL path for workspace scope.

---

## Response format

Responses follow a consistent structure:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

Errors:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "errors": ["Error message"]
}
```

---

## Rate limits

API rate limits apply. Check response headers for `X-RateLimit-*` when available.
