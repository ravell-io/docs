## What is Ravell?

**Ravell is your Product Agent:** one place to ask questions and get evidence-backed answers from your Linear, Notion, Intercom, Slack, and more — in seconds, with citations. We don't replace your tools; we turn them into a **single source of truth** for product intelligence.

## Core features

| Feature | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Web Asks** | Ask questions in the app. Ravell searches your sources, retrieves evidence, and synthesizes answers with citations. Full pipeline transparency via streaming thoughts. |
| **Slack Agent** | Use Ravell in Slack via `/ravell`. Ask questions, create Linear issues, manage agents — all in natural language, in-thread. |
| **Agents** | Schedule recurring questions (e.g. weekly summaries). Reports land in your Inbox and optionally in Slack. Same quality as Web Asks, on a schedule. |

All three use the same connected sources (Linear, Notion, Intercom, Slack) and the same evidence-backed pipeline. Connect sources once; use them everywhere.

## Where to do what

| Area | What you do |
|------|-------------|
| **Inbox** | Read proactive reports from your agents. |
| **Agents** | Create and manage scheduled queries. |
| **Sources** | Connect and manage Linear, Notion, Intercom, Slack. |
| **Context** | View and edit profiles (individual + workspace) and Memory for AI personalization. |
| **Asks** | One-off questions and follow-ups; each Ask is a thread with answers and citations. |

**New Ask** in the sidebar starts a new question. **Asks** lists your past and current conversations.

## In short

**Sources** = what Ravell knows. **Asks** = one-off Q&A with citations. **Agents** = scheduled questions; reports go to **Inbox**. Ravell is the **institutional memory layer**: evidence-backed answers and proactive alerts so you spend less time searching and more time deciding.
