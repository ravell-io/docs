## What is Ravell?

**Ravell is your Product Agent:** one place to ask questions and get evidence-backed answers from your Linear, Notion, Intercom, Slack, and more — in seconds, with citations. We don't replace your tools; we turn them into a **single source of truth** for product intelligence.

## Three ways to get value

| What | How |
|------|-----|
| **Ask** | Type a question in plain language; get an answer with citations in seconds. |
| **Automations** | Schedule recurring questions (e.g. weekly summaries); results land in your Inbox. |
| **Connect sources** | Link Linear, Notion, Intercom, Slack. The more you connect, the better the answers. |

---

## Where to do what

| Area | What you do |
|------|-------------|
| **Inbox** | Read proactive reports from your automations. |
| **Automations** | Create and manage scheduled queries. |
| **Sources** | Connect and manage Linear, Notion, Intercom, Slack. |
| **Asks** | One-off questions and follow-ups; each Ask is a thread with answers and citations. |

**New Ask** in the sidebar starts a new question. **Asks** lists your past and current conversations.

## In short

**Sources** = what Ravell knows. **Asks** = one-off Q&A with citations. **Automations** = scheduled questions; reports go to **Inbox**. Ravell is the **institutional memory layer**: evidence-backed answers and proactive alerts so you spend less time searching and more time deciding.
