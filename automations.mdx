## What are Automations?

**Automations** are scheduled queries that run on a recurring basis. You define a question (e.g. "What are the top open issues in our current cycle?") and a schedule (e.g. every Monday at 9am). Ravell runs the question at the scheduled time and delivers the report to your Inbox.

## Create an automation

1. Open **Automations** in the sidebar.
2. Click **Create automation**.
3. Enter your question (same format as an Ask).
4. Choose a schedule: daily, weekly, or custom (e.g. every Monday at 9am).
5. Optionally scope to specific sources (Linear, Notion, Intercom, Slack).
6. Save. The automation will run at the next scheduled time.

## Manage automations

- **Pause**: Pause an automation to stop it from running. Resume when ready.
- **Edit**: Change the question, schedule, or source scope.
- **Run now**: Trigger a run immediately instead of waiting for the schedule.
- **Delete**: Remove the automation. Past runs remain in the Inbox.

## Use cases

- **Weekly summaries**: "Summarize customer feedback from Intercom this week" every Friday.
- **Standup digests**: "What are the top 5 issues in progress?" every morning.
- **Recurring reports**: "What did we ship last week?" every Monday for team sync.

## Reports in the Inbox

Each automation run produces a report that appears in your **Inbox**. The report has the same format as an Ask answer: evidence-backed, with citations. Open a run to read it, or use **Open in Chats** to follow up with more questions.
