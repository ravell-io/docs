## What are Agents?

**Agents** are scheduled queries that run on a recurring basis. You define a question (e.g. "What are the top open issues in our current cycle?") and a schedule (e.g. every Monday at 9am). Ravell runs the question at the scheduled time and delivers the report to your Inbox — and optionally to a Slack channel.

Each run produces the same kind of evidence-backed answer you get from a Web Ask: citations, grounded in your connected sources. You can open a run to read it, follow up with more questions, or push it to Notion.

**Why it matters:** Same search and synthesis quality as Web Asks, on a schedule. You run it once; Ravell runs it when you need it. Simple questions stay fast; complex ones get the extra effort they need. Proactive insights without manually asking each time.

---

## How it works

1. You create an agent with a question and schedule.
2. At the scheduled time, Ravell runs the question through the same pipeline as Web Asks (intent, plan, search, synthesize).
3. The report appears in your **Inbox** (and in Slack if you enabled delivery).
4. You can open the run, read it, or use **Open in Chats** to follow up.

Agents use the same search and synthesis quality as Web Asks. The only difference is timing: you run it once, Ravell runs it on a schedule.

## Behind the scenes

At the scheduled time, Ravell runs your question through the same pipeline as Web Asks — intent, plan, search, synthesize, verify. The report appears in your Inbox and, if you enabled it, in Slack. If the same question was answered recently, Ravell may reuse that result to speed things up. Failed runs are retried; after several failures, the agent pauses so you can fix the issue.

## Create an agent

1. Open **Agents** in the sidebar.
2. Click **Create agent** (or start from a template).
3. Enter your question — same format as Web Asks. Be specific: time ranges and topics improve results.
4. Choose a schedule (see below).
5. Set visibility (private or shared).
6. Optionally enable **Deliver to Slack** and select a channel (requires shared visibility).
7. Save. The agent runs at the next scheduled time.

## Schedule options

### Weekly

Run on specific days at a specific time. Examples:

- Every Monday at 9am
- Every weekday at 8am
- Every Friday at 5pm

You choose the days (Mon–Sun), hour, and minute. Times are in your selected timezone.

### Hourly interval

Run every N hours. Examples:

- Every 1 hour
- Every 2 hours
- Every 4 hours

Useful for high-frequency digests (e.g. "What's new in the last hour?"). The interval starts from when the agent was created.

---

## Timezone

Agents run in the timezone you select when creating. Default is your browser timezone. Use this to align with your team's schedule (e.g. 9am local time for standup prep).

---

## Templates

When creating an agent, you can start from a **template**. Templates pre-fill the question and schedule for common use cases:

- **Weekly product roundup** — Top issues and feature requests from Linear.
- **Daily standup prep** — Customer feedback from yesterday.
- **Churn signals** — Accounts showing churn risk in the last 7 days.
- **Support trends** — Intercom ticket trends and themes.
- **Customer discovery gaps** — Questions to ask customers.
- **Priorities** — What to focus on this week.
- **And more** — Alignment, satisfaction, competitive, expansion, docs.

You can edit the template's question and schedule before saving.

---

## Visibility

- **Private** — Only you see the agent and its runs. Runs appear in your Inbox only.
- **Shared** — Visible to your workspace. Teammates can see the agent and its runs. Required for Slack delivery.

---

## Manage agents

- **Pause** — Pause an agent to stop it from running. Resume when ready.
- **Edit** — Change the question, schedule, visibility, or Slack delivery.
- **Run now** — Trigger a run immediately instead of waiting for the schedule.
- **Delete** — Remove the agent. Past runs remain in the Inbox.

---

## Reports in the Inbox

Each agent run produces a report that appears in your **Inbox**. The report has the same format as an Ask answer: evidence-backed, with citations. Open a run to read it, or use **Open in Chats** to follow up with more questions.

Runs are ordered by most recent first. If a run fails, you'll see the status; you can retry by running the agent manually.

---

## Deliver to Slack

When Slack is connected, you can deliver agent reports directly to a Slack channel:

1. Create or edit an agent.
2. Set visibility to **Shared with workspace** (Slack delivery requires shared agents).
3. Enable **Deliver to Slack** and select the channel.
4. Save. When the agent runs, the report is posted to the selected channel.

Reports appear in the channel with the same format as in the Inbox: evidence-backed, with citations. Teammates can read them without opening Ravell.

---

## Use cases

- **Weekly summaries** — "Summarize customer feedback from Intercom this week" every Friday.
- **Standup digests** — "What are the top 5 issues in progress?" every morning.
- **Recurring reports** — "What did we ship last week?" every Monday for team sync.
- **Churn alerts** — "Which accounts showed churn risk in the last 7 days?" every Friday.
- **Support trends** — "Summarize Intercom ticket trends this week" every Monday.

## Future: Richer agent experience

Agents are evolving toward a more conversational experience — you'll be able to manage them from the Slack Agent or Web Asks with richer scheduling and delivery options. The core idea stays the same: define a question, set a schedule, get reports in your Inbox or Slack.
