## What are Automations?

**Automations** are scheduled queries that run on a recurring basis. You define a question (e.g. "What are the top open issues in our current cycle?") and a schedule (e.g. every Monday at 9am). Ravell runs the question at the scheduled time and delivers the report to your Inbox — and optionally to a Slack channel.

Each run produces the same kind of evidence-backed answer you get from a Web Ask: citations, grounded in your connected sources. You can open a run to read it, follow up with more questions, or push it to Notion.

---

## How it works

1. You create an automation with a question and schedule.
2. At the scheduled time, Ravell runs the question through the same pipeline as Web Asks (intent, plan, search, synthesize).
3. The report appears in your **Inbox** (and in Slack if you enabled delivery).
4. You can open the run, read it, or use **Open in Chats** to follow up.

Automations use the same search and synthesis quality as Web Asks. The only difference is timing: you run it once, Ravell runs it on a schedule.

## How it works under the hood

For the technically curious, here's the detailed flow from schedule to report.

### 1. Scheduler (cron)

A **scheduler job** runs every minute (`enqueue_due_prompt_runs`). It finds all automations where `next_run_at <= now` and `status = active`, and for each:

- Creates a `PromptAutomationRun` with status `queued`.
- Enqueues `RunPromptAutomationJob`.
- Updates `next_run_at` to the next occurrence (using the RRULE and timezone).

Idempotency keys prevent duplicate runs for the same scheduled time.

### 2. Run executor

When the job runs, the **RunExecutor**:

1. **Validates** — Automation still active, creator still has workspace access. If not, marks run as `skipped`.
2. **Creates query session** — Uses `Queries::Creators::Create` with the automation's prompt. This creates a `QuerySession` and a `Chat` (if the automation has one).
3. **Runs pipeline** — Calls `ProcessQueryJob.perform_now` with `streaming: false`. The same pipeline as Web Asks runs: intent, plan, search, cluster, synthesize, verify. No real-time streaming — the job runs synchronously until complete.
4. **Finalizes** — On success: updates run status, stores `query_session_id`, updates `last_run_at` and `next_run_at`, resets `consecutive_failures`. On error: increments `consecutive_failures`, auto-pauses after 5 failures.

### 3. Inbox and Slack delivery

- **Inbox** — The run is linked to the automation's chat. The frontend subscribes via ActionCable (`automation_run_completed`); new runs appear in the Inbox.
- **Slack delivery** — If `slack_delivery_enabled` is true, `ReportDeliveryService` posts the report to the configured channel. Long answers get a TLDR; the full report is linked via `View full answer` to the chat in the app.

### 4. Caching

If the same question was recently answered (cache hit), the executor can skip the pipeline and use the cached response. This speeds up repeated runs (e.g. hourly automations with the same prompt).

## Create an automation

1. Open **Automations** in the sidebar.
2. Click **Create automation** (or start from a template).
3. Enter your question — same format as Web Asks. Be specific: time ranges and topics improve results.
4. Choose a schedule (see below).
5. Set visibility (private or shared).
6. Optionally enable **Deliver to Slack** and select a channel (requires shared visibility).
7. Save. The automation runs at the next scheduled time.

---

## Schedule options

### Weekly

Run on specific days at a specific time. Examples:

- Every Monday at 9am
- Every weekday at 8am
- Every Friday at 5pm

You choose the days (Mon–Sun), hour, and minute. Times are in your selected timezone.

### Hourly interval

Run every N hours. Examples:

- Every 1 hour
- Every 2 hours
- Every 4 hours

Useful for high-frequency digests (e.g. "What's new in the last hour?"). The interval starts from when the automation was created.

---

## Timezone

Automations run in the timezone you select when creating. Default is your browser timezone. Use this to align with your team's schedule (e.g. 9am local time for standup prep).

---

## Templates

When creating an automation, you can start from a **template**. Templates pre-fill the question and schedule for common use cases:

- **Weekly product roundup** — Top issues and feature requests from Linear.
- **Daily standup prep** — Customer feedback from yesterday.
- **Churn signals** — Accounts showing churn risk in the last 7 days.
- **Support trends** — Intercom ticket trends and themes.
- **Customer discovery gaps** — Questions to ask customers.
- **Priorities** — What to focus on this week.
- **And more** — Alignment, satisfaction, competitive, expansion, docs.

You can edit the template's question and schedule before saving.

---

## Visibility

- **Private** — Only you see the automation and its runs. Runs appear in your Inbox only.
- **Shared** — Visible to your workspace. Teammates can see the automation and its runs. Required for Slack delivery.

---

## Manage automations

- **Pause** — Pause an automation to stop it from running. Resume when ready.
- **Edit** — Change the question, schedule, visibility, or Slack delivery.
- **Run now** — Trigger a run immediately instead of waiting for the schedule.
- **Delete** — Remove the automation. Past runs remain in the Inbox.

---

## Reports in the Inbox

Each automation run produces a report that appears in your **Inbox**. The report has the same format as an Ask answer: evidence-backed, with citations. Open a run to read it, or use **Open in Chats** to follow up with more questions.

Runs are ordered by most recent first. If a run fails, you'll see the status; you can retry by running the automation manually.

---

## Deliver to Slack

When Slack is connected, you can deliver automation reports directly to a Slack channel:

1. Create or edit an automation.
2. Set visibility to **Shared with workspace** (Slack delivery requires shared automations).
3. Enable **Deliver to Slack** and select the channel.
4. Save. When the automation runs, the report is posted to the selected channel.

Reports appear in the channel with the same format as in the Inbox: evidence-backed, with citations. Teammates can read them without opening Ravell.

## Use cases

- **Weekly summaries** — "Summarize customer feedback from Intercom this week" every Friday.
- **Standup digests** — "What are the top 5 issues in progress?" every morning.
- **Recurring reports** — "What did we ship last week?" every Monday for team sync.
- **Churn alerts** — "Which accounts showed churn risk in the last 7 days?" every Friday.
- **Support trends** — "Summarize Intercom ticket trends this week" every Monday.

## Future: Automations as agent

Automations are evolving toward a more agent-like experience — you'll be able to manage them conversationally (e.g. from the Slack Agent or Web Asks) with richer scheduling and delivery options. The core idea stays the same: define a question, set a schedule, get reports in your Inbox or Slack.
