## What is the Slack Agent?

The **Slack Agent** brings Ravell into Slack. Use the slash command (e.g. `/ravell`) in any channel or DM to ask questions, create or update Linear records, and manage automations — all in natural language. No forms, no buttons: just type what you want.

Ravell responds in-thread with answers and citations. Long answers include a **View full answer** button to open the full report in the app. While processing, you may see **Follow along in Ravell** to watch the answer stream in real time.

## How it differs from Web Asks

| Aspect | Web Asks | Slack Agent |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Where** | app.ravell.io | Slack (channel or DM) |
| **Input** | Main input, sidebar | Slash command + message |
| **Response** | Full answer with Sources rail | In-thread answer; long answers truncated with link |
| **Linear actions** | Via follow-up agent | Natural language ("Create a bug about X") |
| **Automations** | In Automations view | Natural language ("Create an automation that...") |
| **Context** | Full UI, Context view | Thread context, Memory |

The Slack Agent uses the same search pipeline and sources as Web Asks. It also has dedicated sub-agents for Linear and Automations, so you can create issues, update projects, or manage automations without leaving Slack.

## How it works under the hood

For the technically curious, here's the detailed flow from Slack message to response.

### 1. Slash command or message

When you type `/ravell` or reply in a thread, Slack sends the payload to Ravell. The **Slack Commands** controller handles slash commands; the **Slack Events** controller handles app mentions and thread replies. A `SlackThreadSession` tracks the conversation; each turn becomes a `SlackTurn`.

### 2. Query critic

Before processing, a **query critic** checks for off-topic or prompt-injection attempts. If the query fails, Ravell responds with a polite deflection (e.g. "I'm only useful for your actual product work...") instead of running the pipeline.

### 3. Routing: follow-up vs agent

A **router** decides how to handle the message:

- **Stream follow-up** — For simple follow-ups answerable from conversation memory (e.g. "Which of those?"), the Follow-up agent answers from context or uses tools. No full pipeline.
- **Slack agent** — For new questions or action requests, the Slack Agent runs. It has access to: `pipeline` (full search), `structured_retrieval` (lookups), `delegate_to_linear` (Linear CRUD), `delegate_to_automations` (automation CRUD), and `explain_capabilities` (help).

### 4. Agent execution

The Slack Agent is an LLM with tools. It chooses which tool to call based on the question:

- **Search questions** → `pipeline` tool. This creates a `QuerySession` and runs the same pipeline as Web Asks (intent, plan, search, synthesize). The agent receives the full answer and formats it for Slack.
- **Lookups** ("Find ENG-142") → `structured_retrieval`.
- **Create/update Linear** → `delegate_to_linear` (delegates to the Linear sub-agent).
- **Automation requests** → `delegate_to_automations` (delegates to the Automations sub-agent).
- **Help** → `explain_capabilities`.

The agent has a max of 3 tool calls per turn. If it fails, it falls back along a chain: `structured_retrieval` → `pipeline` → `explain_capabilities`.

### 5. Response formatting

For long answers, a **TLDR generator** produces a short summary. The **AnswerFormatter** builds Slack Block Kit: section (answer text), context blocks (citations), and a "View full answer" button linking to `app.ravell.io/app/c/{slug}`.

### 6. Posting to Slack

The response is posted in-thread. If the answer was long, the user sees the TLDR + button; the full answer lives in the linked chat. A progress message ("Still working...") may be posted ephemerally with a "Follow along in Ravell" button while the pipeline runs.

---

## Setup

1. Connect **Slack** as a source (see [Slack integration](/integrations/slack)).
2. The Slack Agent is enabled when Slack is connected.
3. Use the configured slash command (e.g. `/ravell`) in any channel or DM where the app is installed.

---

## Ask questions

Type `/ravell` followed by your question. Ravell searches your connected sources (Linear, Notion, Intercom, Slack) and responds in-thread with an answer and citations.

Examples:

- `/ravell What are the top open issues in our current cycle?`
- `/ravell Summarize customer feedback from Intercom this week.`
- `/ravell Find ENG-142` — Look up a specific Linear issue.
- `/ravell What did we discuss about the API last week?` — Search Slack (when indexed).

---

## Linear actions (natural language)

You can create and update Linear records by typing requests in plain language. No forms or buttons — just describe what you want.

### Issues

- `/ravell Create a bug about login timeouts`
- `/ravell File a ticket for the auth problem we discussed`
- `/ravell Update ENG-123 to done`
- `/ravell Close that issue` — Uses thread context when you say "that" or "this".

### Projects, initiatives, documents

- `/ravell Create a project for the checkout redesign`
- `/ravell Update the Backend initiative status`
- `/ravell Create a Linear document for the API spec`

### Customer requests

- `/ravell Log this as a customer request on ENG-123` — Links feedback to an issue.
- `/ravell Create a customer record for Acme Corp`

Ravell checks for duplicates before creating issues and uses conversation context when you refer to "this" or "that". **Linear must be connected** for these actions to work.

---

## Manage automations from Slack

You can create, update, list, pause, resume, and delete automations directly from Slack.

Examples:

- `/ravell Create an automation that runs every Monday at 9am summarizing top issues`
- `/ravell Create an automation that fires every morning gathering customer complaints`
- `/ravell Send that report to #product instead` — Update delivery channel.
- `/ravell What automations do I have?`
- `/ravell Pause the weekly report`
- `/ravell Resume the standup digest`

---

## In-thread follow-ups

Reply in the thread to ask follow-up questions. Ravell keeps conversation context, so you can say things like:

- "Which of those are high priority?"
- "Create a bug for that"
- "Update the automation to run on Fridays"

---

## View full answer and follow along

- **View full answer**: When an answer is long, Ravell posts a summary with a **View full answer** button. Click it to open the full answer with citations in the Ravell app.
- **Follow along in Ravell**: While Ravell is processing, you may see a **Follow along in Ravell** button. Click it to watch the answer stream in the app in real time.

---

## Help

Ask what Ravell can do:

- `/ravell What can you do?`
- `/ravell Help`

Ravell will explain its capabilities: search, Linear actions, automations, and more.

---

## Channel vs DM

You can use the Slack Agent in both channels and DMs. In channels, the conversation is visible to everyone in the channel; in DMs, only you and Ravell see it. Choose based on whether the question is team-wide or personal.

---

## Permissions

The Slack Agent respects your workspace permissions. You can only ask questions about data you have access to, and create or update Linear records in workspaces you are a member of.
