## Overview

The **Slack Agent** lets you use Ravell directly from Slack. Ask questions via slash commands, get answers in-thread with citations, and create or update Linear issues without leaving Slack.

---

## Setup

1. Connect **Slack** as a source (see [Slack integration](/integrations/slack)).
2. The Slack Agent is enabled when Slack is connected.
3. Use the configured slash command (e.g. `/ravell`) in any channel or DM where the app is installed.

---

## Ask questions in Slack

1. Type `/ravell` followed by your question.
2. Send the message.
3. Ravell responds in-thread with an answer and citations, same format as in the app.

Examples:

- `/ravell What are the top open issues in our current cycle?`
- `/ravell Summarize customer feedback from Intercom this week.`

---

## In-thread follow-ups

You can reply in the thread to ask follow-up questions. Ravell keeps conversation context and answers accordingly.

---

## Create Linear issues from Slack

From a Slack Agent response, you can:

- **Create Linear issue**: Turn a finding or suggestion into a new Linear issue. Ravell pre-fills title and description from the context.
- **Update Linear issue**: Add a comment or update status on an existing issue.

This keeps your workflow in Slack while capturing action items in Linear.

---

## Permissions

The Slack Agent respects your workspace permissions. You can only ask questions about data you have access to, and create/update Linear issues in workspaces you're a member of.
