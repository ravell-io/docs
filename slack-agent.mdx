## What is the Slack Agent?

The **Slack Agent** brings Ravell into Slack. Mention **@Ravell** in any channel or DM to ask questions, create or update Linear records, and manage agents — all in natural language. You can also use the `/ravell` slash command. No forms, no buttons: just type what you want.

Ravell responds in-thread with answers and citations. Long answers include a **View full answer** button to open the full report in the app. While processing, you may see **Follow along in Ravell** to watch the answer stream in real time.

**Why it matters:** Ravell acts as an assistant that can both answer and execute. For broad questions, it runs the full pipeline; for specific lookups ("Find ENG-142"), it does fast, targeted queries. It can create or update Linear issues, manage agents, and push to Notion instead of only describing what to do. In threads, it remembers prior turns and citations so it can build on earlier answers.

## How it differs from Web Asks

| Aspect | Web Asks | Slack Agent |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Where** | app.ravell.io | Slack (channel or DM) |
| **Input** | Main input, sidebar | @Ravell mention or /ravell + message |
| **Response** | Full answer with Sources rail | In-thread answer; long answers truncated with link |
| **Linear actions** | Via follow-up agent | Natural language ("Create a bug about X") |
| **Agents** | In Agents view | Natural language ("Create an agent that...") |
| **Context** | Full UI, Context view | Thread context, Memory |

The Slack Agent uses the same search pipeline and sources as Web Asks. It also has dedicated sub-agents for Linear and Agents, so you can create issues, update projects, or manage agents without leaving Slack.

## Behind the scenes

When you message Ravell in Slack, it decides whether you're asking a follow-up (answerable from the thread) or something new. Follow-ups get a quick response from context; new questions or actions trigger the full pipeline — the same one Web Asks uses.

Ravell picks the right tool for the job: full search for broad questions, quick lookups for specific items like "Find ENG-142", and delegation to Linear or Agents when you want to create or update something. Long answers get a short summary in Slack plus a "View full answer" link to the full report in the app.

---

## Setup

1. Connect **Slack** as a source (see [Slack integration](/integrations/slack)).
2. The Slack Agent is enabled when Slack is connected.
3. Mention **@Ravell** or use the `/ravell` slash command in any channel or DM where the app is installed.

---

## Ask questions

Mention **@Ravell** (or type `/ravell`) followed by your question. Ravell searches your connected sources (Linear, Notion, Intercom, Slack) and responds in-thread with an answer and citations.

Examples:

- `@Ravell What are the top open issues in our current cycle?`
- `@Ravell Summarize customer feedback from Intercom this week.`
- `@Ravell Find ENG-142` — Look up a specific Linear issue.
- `@Ravell What did we discuss about the API last week?` — Search Slack (when indexed).

---

## Linear actions (natural language)

You can create and update Linear records by typing requests in plain language. No forms or buttons — just describe what you want.

### Issues

- `@Ravell Create a bug about login timeouts`
- `@Ravell File a ticket for the auth problem we discussed`
- `@Ravell Update ENG-123 to done`
- `@Ravell Close that issue` — Uses thread context when you say "that" or "this".

### Projects, initiatives, documents

- `@Ravell Create a project for the checkout redesign`
- `@Ravell Update the Backend initiative status`
- `@Ravell Create a Linear document for the API spec`

### Customer requests

- `@Ravell Log this as a customer request on ENG-123` — Links feedback to an issue.
- `@Ravell Create a customer record for Acme Corp`

Ravell checks for duplicates before creating issues and uses conversation context when you refer to "this" or "that". **Linear must be connected** for these actions to work.

---

## Manage agents from Slack

You can create, update, list, pause, resume, and delete agents directly from Slack.

Examples:

- `@Ravell Create an agent that runs every Monday at 9am summarizing top issues`
- `@Ravell Create an agent that fires every morning gathering customer complaints`
- `@Ravell Send that report to #product instead` — Update delivery channel.
- `@Ravell What agents do I have?`
- `@Ravell Pause the weekly report`
- `@Ravell Resume the standup digest`

---

## In-thread follow-ups

Reply in the thread to ask follow-up questions. Ravell keeps conversation context, so you can say things like:

- "Which of those are high priority?"
- "Create a bug for that"
- "Update the agent to run on Fridays"

---

## View full answer and follow along

- **View full answer**: When an answer is long, Ravell posts a summary with a **View full answer** button. Click it to open the full answer with citations in the Ravell app.
- **Follow along in Ravell**: While Ravell is processing, you may see a **Follow along in Ravell** button. Click it to watch the answer stream in the app in real time.

---

## Help

Ask what Ravell can do:

- `@Ravell What can you do?`
- `@Ravell Help`

Ravell will explain its capabilities: search, Linear actions, agents, and more.

---

## Channel vs DM

You can use the Slack Agent in both channels and DMs. In channels, the conversation is visible to everyone in the channel; in DMs, only you and Ravell see it. Choose based on whether the question is team-wide or personal.

---

## Permissions

The Slack Agent respects your workspace permissions. You can only ask questions about data you have access to, and create or update Linear records in workspaces you are a member of.
