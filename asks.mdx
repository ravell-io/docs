## What are Asks?

**Asks** are one-off questions you pose to Ravell. Each Ask is a conversation thread: you ask a question, get an answer with citations, and can follow up to go deeper. Answers are grounded in your connected sources — Linear, Notion, Intercom, Slack — so you always see where the information came from.

## How to ask a question

### Start a new Ask

1. Click **New Ask** in the sidebar, or use the main input when no chat is selected.
2. Type your question in plain language. Examples:
   - "What did customers say about checkout last month?"
   - "What are the top open issues in our current cycle?"
   - "Summarize feedback from Intercom about pricing."
3. Press Enter or click Send. The answer streams in with citations.

### Follow up

You can ask follow-up questions in the same thread. Ravell keeps context from the conversation, so you can say things like:

- "Which of those issues are high priority?"
- "Show me the Linear links for the top 3."
- "What did we decide about the checkout flow?"

## Citations

Every answer includes **citations** — clickable references to the source data. When you click a citation:

- You see the exact excerpt Ravell used.
- You can jump to the original item (Linear issue, Notion page, Intercom conversation, Slack message).

Citations let you verify answers and dig into the evidence yourself.

## Scoping your question

You can scope questions to specific sources for faster, more focused answers:

- **All sources** (default): Ravell searches across everything you've connected.
- **Specific source**: Use the source selector to limit the search (e.g. "Linear only" or "Notion only").

Scoping is useful when you know the answer is likely in one tool.

## Push to Notion

When Notion is connected, you can **push** an answer to a Notion page:

1. Open an Ask with an answer.
2. Click **Push to Notion** on the answer card.
3. Choose the Notion page or database to add the report.
4. The answer (with citations) is added as content in Notion.

Use this to turn Ask results into shared docs, meeting prep, or recurring reports.

## Tips for better answers

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="lightbulb" title="Be specific">
    "What did customers say about checkout in the last 30 days?" works better than "customer feedback." Time ranges and topics help Ravell retrieve the right evidence.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="lightbulb" title="Use follow-ups">
    Start broad, then narrow. Ask "What are the top issues?" then "Which of those are in the current sprint?" to drill down.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="lightbulb" title="Connect more sources">
    The more Linear, Notion, Intercom, and Slack data you connect, the richer and more accurate the answers.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
