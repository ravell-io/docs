## What are Web Asks?

**Web Asks** are the primary way to use Ravell in the app. You type a question in plain language, and Ravell searches your connected sources (Linear, Notion, Intercom, Slack), retrieves relevant evidence, and synthesizes an answer with citations. Each Ask is a conversation thread: you can follow up to go deeper without repeating context.

Answers are grounded in your data — every claim ties back to a source. You always see where the information came from and can verify it yourself.

---

## How it works

When you submit a question, Ravell runs a multi-stage pipeline:

1. **Intent** — Understands what you're asking (e.g. find issues, summarize feedback, compare trends).
2. **Plan** — Breaks the query into sub-questions and selects which sources to search.
3. **Search** — Retrieves relevant documents from Linear, Notion, Intercom, and Slack using semantic and hybrid search.
4. **Cluster & rank** — Groups evidence by theme and ranks by relevance.
5. **Synthesize** — Generates the answer, grounding each claim in the retrieved evidence.
6. **Verify** — Checks that claims match the evidence and marks confidence where needed.

You see this progress as **streaming thoughts** — short status updates like "Breaking the query into sub-questions...", "Searching Linear, Intercom...", "Synthesizing answer...". This transparency helps you understand what Ravell is doing and how long it might take.

## How it works under the hood

For the technically curious, here's the detailed flow from question to answer.

### 1. Intent classification

An LLM classifies the query intent (e.g. `list_issues`, `sentiment_analysis`, `trend_analysis`, `general_search`) and extracts structured signals: timeframe, sources mentioned, priorities, teams. It also assigns a complexity tier (`brief`, `standard`, `deep`, `strategic`) that influences how much reasoning and evidence the pipeline uses.

### 2. Retrieval planning

A planner breaks the query into sub-questions and selects which sources to search (Linear, Notion, Intercom, Slack). It produces a retrieval plan with lanes (e.g. semantic, keyword) and stop criteria (max passes, when to halt).

### 3. Strategy routing

The query type classifier determines the retrieval strategy: `specific_topic` (semantic lookup), `aggregate_ranking` (top-N lists), `comprehensive` (broad search), `trend`, `statistical`, or `comparative`. For statistical queries (e.g. "How many bugs?"), structured aggregation can short-circuit to a direct answer without full retrieval.

### 4. Search stack

Retrieval runs through a hybrid pipeline:

- **Hybrid retriever** — Runs semantic (pgvector) and keyword search in parallel.
- **RRF fusion** — Combines results from multiple lanes using Reciprocal Rank Fusion.
- **Graph expander** — Expands via conversation links (related documents).
- **Prefilter** — Filters by scope, freshness, and relevance.
- **Reranker** — Re-ranks the top candidates with a cross-encoder for final relevance.

### 5. Clustering and distillation

Evidence chips (normalized snippets from sources) are clustered by theme. An evidence distillation step may reduce the set and produce a brief of key claims for synthesis.

### 6. Synthesis and verification

A streaming synthesizer generates the answer, grounding each claim in the retrieved evidence. An inline verifier checks that claims match the evidence and marks confidence. A reflection pass may refine the answer for clarity and completeness.

### 7. Streaming and broadcast

Progress is streamed via ActionCable: thought chunks (e.g. "Searching lanes..."), answer tokens, and citations. The frontend subscribes and renders in real time.

## Asking a question

### Start a new Ask

1. Click **New Ask** in the sidebar, or use the main input when no chat is selected.
2. Type your question in plain language. Be as specific as you can — time ranges, topics, and source hints improve results.
3. Optionally set **visibility** (private or shared) and **scope** (all sources or specific ones).
4. Press Enter or click Send. The answer streams in with citations.

### Example questions

| Question | What Ravell does |
|----------|-------------------|
| "What are the top open issues in our current cycle?" | Searches Linear, ranks by relevance, synthesizes a list with links. |
| "What did customers say about checkout last month?" | Searches Intercom (and optionally Linear/Notion), clusters themes, summarizes. |
| "Summarize feedback from Intercom about pricing." | Filters to Intercom, extracts pricing-related content, synthesizes. |
| "Find ENG-142" | Direct lookup in Linear. |
| "What did we discuss about the API last week?" | Searches Slack (when indexed) for API-related threads. |

---

## Follow-ups

Reply in the same thread to ask follow-up questions. Ravell keeps the full conversation context, so you can say things like:

- "Which of those are high priority?"
- "Show me the Linear links for the top 3."
- "What did we decide about the checkout flow?"
- "Create a bug for that" — Ravell uses the most recent topic when you say "that" or "this".

You don't need to repeat the original question. Follow-ups can refine, narrow, or extend the answer.

---

## Citations

Every answer includes **citations** — clickable references to the source data. When you click a citation:

- You see the exact excerpt Ravell used.
- You can jump to the original item (Linear issue, Notion page, Intercom conversation, Slack message).

Citations let you verify answers and dig into the evidence yourself. If something seems off, check the source.

### Context used panel

The **Sources** rail (next to the answer) may show a "Context used" panel. This displays which profiles (individual and workspace) and Memory were used for the answer, their freshness, and any quality flags. Use **View context used** to jump to the Context view and see or edit your profiles.

---

## Scoping

By default, Ravell searches across all connected sources. You can narrow the search:

- **All sources** (default) — Linear, Notion, Intercom, Slack.
- **Specific source** — Use the source selector to limit (e.g. "Linear only" or "Notion only").

Scoping is useful when:
- You know the answer is in one tool.
- You want faster results (fewer sources = less to search).
- You're testing or comparing answers across tools.

---

## Visibility and sharing

When creating a new Ask, you choose **private** or **shared**:

- **Private** — Only you can see it. Good for exploratory questions or sensitive topics.
- **Shared** — Visible to your workspace. Teammates can open it from the sidebar. Good for collaboration and shared context.

You can change visibility later from the report menu (**Make private** / **Share with workspace**). Use **Copy link** to share a direct URL to an Ask.

---

## Push to Notion

When Notion is connected, you can **push** an answer to a Notion page:

1. Open an Ask with an answer.
2. Click **Push to Notion** on the answer card.
3. Choose the Notion page or database to add the report.
4. The answer (with citations) is added as content in Notion.

Use this to turn Ask results into shared docs, meeting prep, or recurring reports. The content is formatted for Notion (headings, lists, links).

## Tips for better answers

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="lightbulb" title="Be specific">
    "What did customers say about checkout in the last 30 days?" works better than "customer feedback." Time ranges and topics help Ravell retrieve the right evidence.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="lightbulb" title="Use follow-ups">
    Start broad, then narrow. Ask "What are the top issues?" then "Which of those are in the current sprint?" to drill down.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="lightbulb" title="Connect more sources">
    The more Linear, Notion, Intercom, and Slack data you connect, the richer and more accurate the answers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="lightbulb" title="Scope when you know">
    If you know the answer is in Linear, scope to Linear only. It's faster and often more focused.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
