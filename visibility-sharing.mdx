## Private vs shared

When you create a new Ask, you choose its visibility:

- **Private**: Only you can see this Ask. It won't appear in workspace views.
- **Shared**: Visible to your workspace. Teammates can see it in the sidebar; shared asks show avatars of workspace members.

---

## Set visibility when asking

Before submitting your first question, use the visibility toggle (lock/globe icon) next to the input. Click to switch between private and shared. The default depends on your workspace settings.

---

## Change visibility later

You can change an Ask's visibility after it exists:

1. Open the Ask.
2. Click the **•••** (options) menu on the answer card or in the sidebar.
3. Choose **Make private** or **Share with workspace**.

---

## Copy link

To share a direct link to an Ask:

1. Open the Ask.
2. Click the **•••** menu.
3. Choose **Copy link**.

The link opens the Ask directly. Recipients need access to the workspace to view shared asks.

---

## Workspace visibility

Shared asks show workspace member avatars in the sidebar so you can see who else has access. Private asks show only to you.
