## Overview

Connect **Linear** to Ravell to search across your issues, projects, cycles, and initiatives. Ravell indexes this data so you can ask questions like "What are the top open issues in our current cycle?" and get answers with citations to Linear.

## Connect Linear

1. Go to **Sources** or **Settings → Integrations**.
2. Click **Connect** next to Linear.
3. Sign in to Linear (or create an account) and authorize Ravell.
4. Select which **teams** to sync. You can sync all teams or choose specific ones.
5. Ravell starts syncing. Initial sync may take a few minutes.

## What gets synced

- **Issues**: Title, description, status, assignee, labels, project, cycle, initiative.
- **Projects**: Name, description, status.
- **Cycles**: Name, dates, status.
- **Initiatives**: Name, description, status.

Ravell uses this data to answer questions and provide citations back to Linear.

## Team selection

When connecting, you choose which Linear teams to sync. Only data from selected teams is indexed. You can update team selection later in **Settings → Integrations → Linear**.

## Re-sync and reindex

If you add new issues or projects, Ravell syncs periodically. You can also trigger a manual **Reindex** or **Sync** from **Sources** to refresh data immediately.
