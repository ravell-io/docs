## Overview

Connect **Notion** to Ravell to search across your Notion workspace. Ravell indexes pages and databases so you can ask questions like "What did we document about the checkout flow?" and get answers with citations. You can also **push reports to Notion** from Asks and Inbox.

## Connect Notion

1. Go to **Sources** or **Settings → Integrations**.
2. Click **Connect** next to Notion.
3. Sign in to Notion and authorize Ravell.
4. Select which pages or databases to sync (or sync the whole workspace).
5. Ravell starts syncing. Initial sync may take a few minutes for large workspaces.

## What gets synced

- **Pages**: Title, content, properties.
- **Databases**: Schema and entries.

Ravell uses this data to answer questions and provide citations back to Notion pages.

## Push to Notion

From an Ask answer or Inbox report, you can **Push to Notion** to create a new page with the report content. This is useful for:

- Sharing answers with your team in a Notion doc.
- Building a knowledge base of recurring reports.
- Archiving automation outputs.

1. Open an Ask or Inbox report.
2. Click **Push to Notion**.
3. Choose the parent page or database where the new page should go.
4. Confirm. Ravell creates the page with the report content and citations.
