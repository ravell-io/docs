## Overview

Connect **Slack** to Ravell for two main capabilities:

1. **Indexing**: Ravell indexes selected channels so you can search Slack content in Asks (e.g. "What did we discuss about the API last week?").
2. **Slack Agent**: Ask questions in Slack via slash commands and get answers with citations. Create or update Linear issues from Slack.

---

## Connect Slack

1. Go to **Sources** or **Settings → Integrations**.
2. Click **Connect** next to Slack.
3. Sign in to Slack and authorize Ravell.
4. Select which **channels** to index. Only messages from selected channels are searchable.
5. Ravell starts syncing. Initial sync may take a few minutes.

## What gets synced

- **Messages**: From the channels you selected.
- **Threads**: Thread replies are included for context.

Ravell uses this data to answer questions about discussions, decisions, and context shared in Slack.

## Slack Agent

The **Slack Agent** lets you use Ravell directly from Slack via the slash command (e.g. `/ravell`). You can:

- **Ask questions** — Search across Linear, Notion, Intercom, and Slack; get answers with citations.
- **Create and update Linear records** — Issues, projects, initiatives, documents, customer requests — in natural language (e.g. "Create a bug about login timeouts").
- **Manage agents** — Create, update, list, pause, resume, or delete agents from Slack.

See the [Slack Agent](/slack-agent) guide for full details and examples.

## Agent delivery

When creating an **Agent**, you can enable **Deliver to Slack** to post reports to a channel when the agent runs. Reports appear in the channel with citations, same as in the Inbox. Requires the agent to be shared with the workspace. See [Agents](/automations) for details.
