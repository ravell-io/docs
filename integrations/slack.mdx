## Overview

Connect **Slack** to Ravell for two main capabilities:

1. **Indexing**: Ravell indexes selected channels so you can search Slack content in Asks (e.g. "What did we discuss about the API last week?").
2. **Slack Agent**: Ask questions in Slack via slash commands and get answers with citations. Create or update Linear issues from Slack.

---

## Connect Slack

1. Go to **Sources** or **Settings → Integrations**.
2. Click **Connect** next to Slack.
3. Sign in to Slack and authorize Ravell.
4. Select which **channels** to index. Only messages from selected channels are searchable.
5. Ravell starts syncing. Initial sync may take a few minutes.

---

## What gets synced

- **Messages**: From the channels you selected.
- **Threads**: Thread replies are included for context.

Ravell uses this data to answer questions about discussions, decisions, and context shared in Slack.

---

## Slack Agent

The **Slack Agent** lets you ask Ravell directly from Slack.

### Slash commands

- Use the configured slash command (e.g. `/ravell`) in any channel or DM.
- Type your question after the command.
- Ravell responds in-thread with an answer and citations.

### Linear actions from Slack

From a Slack Agent response, you can:

- **Create Linear issue**: Turn a suggestion or finding into a Linear issue.
- **Update Linear issue**: Add a comment or update status from Slack.

This keeps your workflow in Slack while still capturing action items in Linear.
