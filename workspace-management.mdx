## Overview

Workspace management covers members, invitations, and roles. Owners and (where permitted) members can manage these from **Settings**.

---

## Members

**Settings → Members** shows all workspace members with their roles (Owner, Member).

- **Change role**: Owners can promote or demote members.
- **Suspend**: Temporarily revoke access. The member can be unsuspended later.
- **Remove**: Permanently remove a member from the workspace.

---

## Invitations

**Settings → Invitations** (or **Members → Invite**) lets you invite people by email. A badge appears on Invitations when you have pending invites to review.

- **Send invitation**: Enter email, optionally set role. The invitee receives an email with a link.
- **Pending invitations**: View and cancel pending invites.
- **Accept/Decline**: Invitees use the link in the email to accept or decline. Once accepted, they become members.

---

## Roles

- **Owner**: Full access. Can manage members, billing, invitations, and delete the workspace.
- **Member**: Can use Asks, Agents, Inbox, Sources. Cannot manage billing or remove other members.

Only owners can change roles and manage invitations.

## Workspace settings

**Settings → Workspace** (or **General**) lets you:

- Update workspace name.
- Complete onboarding (if applicable).
- Delete workspace (owners only).
