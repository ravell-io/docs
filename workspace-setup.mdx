## What is a workspace?

A **workspace** is your team's shared space in Ravell. All sources (Linear, Notion, Intercom, Slack), Asks, Agents, and Inbox reports live in a workspace. Members share access to the same data and can collaborate on questions and reports.

---

## Create a workspace

1. Sign in at [app.ravell.io](https://app.ravell.io).
2. If you don't have a workspace yet, you'll be prompted to create one.
3. Enter a name (e.g. "Acme Product Team") and confirm.
4. You become the **owner** of the workspace.

---

## Invite members

1. Open **Settings** (gear icon) and go to **Members**.
2. Click **Invite member**.
3. Enter their email address.
4. They receive an invitation email with a link to join.

Members can **accept** or **decline** the invitation. Once they accept, they can access the workspace and all its sources, Asks, and Agents.

---

## Roles

Workspace members have roles that control what they can do:

- **Owner**: Full access. Can manage members, billing, and delete the workspace.
- **Member**: Can use Asks, Agents, Inbox, and Sources. Cannot manage billing or remove other members.

Roles are managed in **Settings → Members**. Owners can change a member's role or suspend/remove them.

## Switch workspaces

If you belong to multiple workspaces, use the workspace picker in the sidebar to switch. Each workspace has its own sources, Asks, and Agents.
