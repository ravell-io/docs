## What are Profiles?

**Profiles** describe who you are and what you work on. Ravell uses profiles to personalize answers — for example, prioritizing issues assigned to you or focusing on projects you care about.

There are two types:

- **Individual profile**: Your personal context (role, focus areas, projects).
- **Workspace profile**: Your team's context (mission, key projects, priorities).

## Individual profile

Your individual profile helps Ravell tailor answers to you:

- **Role**: e.g. "Product Manager", "Engineer".
- **Focus areas**: What you work on (e.g. "Checkout flow", "Mobile app").
- **Projects**: Specific projects or initiatives you care about.

Ravell uses this to surface relevant issues, conversations, and context when you ask questions.

## Workspace profile

The workspace profile describes your team:

- **Mission**: What the team is trying to achieve.
- **Key projects**: Important initiatives or products.
- **Priorities**: Current focus areas.

This helps Ravell understand context when answering questions that span the whole workspace.

## Refresh and exclusions

- **Refresh**: Update your profile when your role or focus changes. Stale profiles lead to less relevant answers.
- **Exclusions**: You can exclude certain topics or sources from being used in your answers if needed (e.g. for privacy or relevance).

## How profiles affect answers

When you ask a question, Ravell considers:

- Your individual profile (to prioritize what matters to you).
- The workspace profile (to align with team priorities).
- The sources you've connected (Linear, Notion, Intercom, Slack).

Better profiles lead to more relevant, actionable answers.
