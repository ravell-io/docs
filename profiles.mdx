## What are Profiles?

**Profiles** describe who you are and what you work on. Ravell uses profiles to personalize answers — for example, prioritizing issues assigned to you or focusing on projects you care about.

**Why it matters:** Ravell learns your role, current work, and priorities from Linear, Slack, and past conversations. It understands your product, teams, and roadmap so answers are grounded in your reality, not generic. You get an answer immediately using cached profiles; refresh happens in the background. Answers feel tailored to you and your team from the first question.

There are two types:

- **Individual profile**: Your personal context (role, focus areas, projects).
- **Workspace profile**: Your team's context (mission, key projects, priorities).

## Individual profile

Your individual profile helps Ravell tailor answers to you. It includes:

- **Who you are**: Role (e.g. "Product Manager", "Engineer"), focus areas.
- **Preferences**: How you like answers formatted, level of detail.
- **Current work**: What you're actively working on.
- **Planned work**: Upcoming initiatives or projects.

Ravell uses this to surface relevant issues, conversations, and context when you ask questions.

## Workspace profile

The workspace profile describes your team. It includes:

- **Company context**: What the company does, market position.
- **Product context**: Main products or services.
- **Goals**: What the team is trying to achieve.
- **Team projects**: Important initiatives or products.
- **ICP (Ideal customer profile)**: Who you serve.
- **Operating context**: How the team works, constraints.

This helps Ravell understand context when answering questions that span the whole workspace.

## Refresh and exclusions

- **Refresh**: Update your profile when your role or focus changes. Use **Refresh** in Context to regenerate from your connected sources. Stale profiles lead to less relevant answers.
- **Source exclusions**: Exclude specific sources (e.g. Linear) from being used in your profile context if needed (e.g. for privacy or relevance).
- **Section overrides**: You can manually override AI-generated sections when the auto-generated content isn't quite right.

## How profiles affect answers

When you ask a question, Ravell considers:

- Your individual profile (to prioritize what matters to you).
- The workspace profile (to align with team priorities).
- The sources you've connected (Linear, Notion, Intercom, Slack).

Better profiles lead to more relevant, actionable answers.

## Context used panel

When viewing an answer, the **Sources** rail may show a "Context used" panel. This displays which profile versions were used, freshness, and any quality flags. Quality flags indicate when profile data may need attention (e.g. stale or incomplete sections).
