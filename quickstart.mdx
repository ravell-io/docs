## Get started in three steps

Sign in, connect a source, and ask your first question.

### Step 1: Sign in and create a workspace

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="user" title="Sign in">
    Go to [app.ravell.io](https://app.ravell.io) and sign in with your email or Google. If you're joining an existing team, accept the workspace invitation from your email.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="building" title="Create or join a workspace">
    A **workspace** is your team's shared space. If you're the first from your team:
    1. Create a new workspace and give it a name.
    2. Invite teammates from **Settings → Members**.
    
    If you received an invitation, accept it to join an existing workspace.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Connect your first source

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="plug" title="Connect Linear, Notion, Intercom, or Slack">
    1. Open **Sources** in the sidebar (or **Settings → Integrations**).
    2. Click **Connect** next to Linear, Notion, Intercom, or Slack.
    3. Complete the OAuth flow in the popup.
    4. For Linear: select which teams to sync. For Slack: select which channels to index.
    
    Ravell will start syncing your data. The more sources you connect, the better your answers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Wait for sync">
    Initial sync can take a few minutes depending on how much data you have. You can start asking questions once sync completes — check **Sources** for status.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Ask your first question

<Accordion icon="message-question" title="Ask in plain language">
  1. Click **New Ask** in the sidebar or use the main input.
  2. Type a question, e.g. "What did customers say about checkout last month?" or "What are the top open issues in our current cycle?"
  3. Press Enter. The answer streams in with citations you can click to see the source.
  4. Ask follow-up questions in the same thread for deeper context.
</Accordion>

<Tip>
  **Pro tip:** Scope your question to specific sources (e.g. "from Linear only") for faster, more focused answers. Use the source selector in the input when available.
